# Password Manager

#This program uses Tkinter for a GUI. It stores website, username/email, password into a json file called pword.json. If you need a password it will generate one
#by clicking the button.
#You can change the requirements for the password by looking into the function that controls 
#that and editing the number values.

#I wouldn't use this real world as the file isn't encrypted and this was a project for me to just build a gui application that has additional functionality.
